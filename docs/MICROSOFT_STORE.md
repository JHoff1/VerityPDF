# Microsoft Store release

VerityPDF uses a separate MSIX package for Microsoft Store distribution.
The existing NSIS and MSI installers remain available through GitHub Releases.

## Partner Center identity

The values below are assigned by Partner Center and must be reproduced exactly
in the package manifest:

- Package identity name: `jhoff1.VerityPDF`
- Package identity publisher:
  `CN=1561B86F-CE73-4D7B-8F44-C60003C93D75`
- Package publisher display name: `Jacob Hoffman`
- Package family name: `jhoff1.VerityPDF_d5qb8brqrsqgm`
- Package SID:
  `S-1-15-2-1704797539-5041667-1309756210-1552187419-3052667460-1124945422-1637230155`
- Store ID: `9NTJ3VJLH22M`

Partner Center validates the package identity name, certificate publisher, and
`PublisherDisplayName` against the Product identity page. The package family
name and SID are derived by Windows and are documented here for verification;
they are not copied into `AppxManifest.xml`.

This is the identity of the new VerityPDF Partner Center product. Do not reuse
the retired SovereignPDF identity when building Store packages.

## Build the MSIX

Requirements:

- Windows 10 or 11
- Rust and the normal Tauri build prerequisites
- Windows 10 or 11 SDK, including `MakeAppx.exe`

From the repository root:

```powershell
npm run store:msix
```

To create the native Windows-on-ARM package:

```powershell
rustup target add aarch64-pc-windows-msvc
npm run store:msix:arm64
```

The ARM64 build also requires the Visual Studio C++ ARM64 build tools. GitHub
Actions installs the Rust target and builds both architectures automatically.

To build both packages on GitHub without creating a release, open **Actions →
Validate Microsoft Store packages → Run workflow**. The workflow retains the
x64 and ARM64 packages and their checksums as downloadable artifacts for 30
days.

The command performs a release build without creating the regular installers,
generates the Store assets, packages the executable and PDF file association,
verifies that the resulting package can be unpacked, and writes a SHA-256
checksum.

Output is written under:

```text
src-tauri/target/store/x64/
src-tauri/target/store/arm64/
```

The `.msix` file is the package to upload to Partner Center. It is intentionally
not signed with a local certificate; Microsoft signs the certified Store
package. Direct distribution outside the Store requires a separate trusted
code-signing certificate.

## Versioning

Partner Center requires each uploaded package to have a higher four-part
version than every package previously submitted for the same identity. The
script converts the Tauri version automatically:

```text
0.1.20 -> 0.1.20.0
```

Increment the project version before every Store update.

## Automated Store submission

Tagged releases build the x64 and ARM64 MSIX packages, combine them into one
validated multi-architecture `.msixbundle` inside `VerityPDF.msixupload`, and
submit the update through Microsoft's Store Developer CLI. The submission job
runs only after the regular GitHub release and both Store packages have built
successfully.

The GitHub environment must be named `microsoft-store` and contain these
environment secrets:

- `AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID`
- `AZURE_AD_APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID`
- `AZURE_AD_APPLICATION_SECRET`
- `SELLER_ID`

It must also contain this environment variable:

- `MS_STORE_PRODUCT_ID` (`9NTJ3VJLH22M`)

The Entra application represented by those credentials must have the
`Manager (Windows)` role in Partner Center. Protection rules such as a required
reviewer can be configured on the GitHub environment if each Store submission
should require manual approval. Certification and publication remain managed
by Partner Center after the workflow submits the package.

## Store listing assets

Customer-facing artwork is stored in `src-tauri/store/listing-assets/`.
Validate its dimensions, transparency, and file size before uploading:

```powershell
npm run store:assets:validate
```

The Store screenshots use a generated demonstration document containing no
real customer or developer information. Regenerate it with:

```powershell
npm run store:demo-pdf
```

The exact Partner Center field mapping and ready-to-paste listing copy are in
[`STORE_LISTING.md`](STORE_LISTING.md).

## Certification checks

The Windows App Certification Kit must run as administrator within an active
Windows user session. After building the x64 package, open PowerShell with
**Run as administrator**, change to the repository directory, and run:

```powershell
npm run store:wack
```

The certification report is written under
`src-tauri/target/store/certification/`.

Before submission:

1. Install the package on a clean Windows user profile.
2. Run the Windows App Certification Kit against the installed package.
3. Open a PDF through its file association.
4. Verify Open, Save, Save As, Print, OCR, and offline operation.
5. Confirm that uninstalling removes the app while leaving user-created PDFs
   and backups untouched.
6. Confirm that the release workflow's **Submit Microsoft Store update** job
   successfully places the new submission into Partner Center certification.
